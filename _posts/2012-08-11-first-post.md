This site/blog is intended to be a dumping ground for the research that
[I](https://github.com/rtyler) am doing into the subject of "Operations
Anti-Patterns."

My goal is to curate a list of useful anecdotes and war stories that, at a
glance, can serve as a good sanity check for Operations solutions in the
future.

In practice, this means I will likely be maintaining this site long after my
talk at PuppetConf 2012. What remains to be seen is how many of my colleagues
are willing to provided non-anonymous Anti-Patterns, until then posts will
probably be anonymous in source but I will strive to "set the scene" for each
one.
