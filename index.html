<h2>What are Anti-Patterns?</h2>

<p>
  From <a target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-patterns">Wikipedia</a>: 

  <blockquote>
    In software engineering, an anti-pattern (or antipattern) is a pattern that may
    be commonly used but is ineffective and/or counterproductive in
    practice.
  </blockquote>

<p>
  For Operations, there is selection of wide-spread Anti-Patterns that are
  applicable to every organization. There is also another variety of
  Anti-Pattern tat will be more localized or application-specific. We are
  priamrily interested in those which were well thought out, seemingly
  reasonable solutions, only for them to turn into painfully complex and
  unwieldy in practice.
